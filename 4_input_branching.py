# Challenge 0: Remember, to do the first thing for any Python activity!

print('branching')

print('------------- Challenge 1')
# Challenge 1:
# Write pseudocode (not real code) for the following application description:
# An application that accepts a username and password and checks them against
# known correct values and then will tell the user if they are logged in or
# not.
# HINT: When writing pseudocode in a code file, put it into comments. In
# Python, that can be accomplished by starting each line with a hash ( # ).


print('------------- Challenge 2')
# Challenge 2:
# Uncomment the following line of code. Use "print" to say what the user typed
# back at them.
username = input('Username? ')
password = input('Password? ')
print(username, password)





print('------------- Challenge 3')
# Challenge 3
# Read the following Pseudocode:
#   if they gave the username of "AzureDiamond" and a password of "hunter2"
#      print "Logged on!"
#   otherwise
#      print "Incorrect, go away"
#
# Can you write it in Python?






print('-------------')

# Advanced Bonus Challenge
#
# Phase 1:
# Here is your task: Write a "data-entry" Python application that accepts:
# 1) a student name, and
# 2) their grade on a quiz (a number out of 100)
# It then adds their grade to a txt based on their name.

# Phase 2 (THIS ONE IS HARD!):
# Have it first ask "Add grade or get grade?"
# If they type "get", then read the file and compute an average grade
# If they type "add", then follow the above logic

# HINT: First pseudocode this, then work on the actual Python.
