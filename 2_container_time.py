# Challenge 0: Remember, what's the first thing you should add to any Python
# file you are working with?
# (Answer: add a "print", to make sure you are editing the right file!)

print('container time')

print('--------------- Challenge 1')
# Challenge 1:
# Modify this list to be a list of your top 5 favorite animals. This can be
# done by following the pattern of 'kitty'.
favorite_animals_list = [
    'kitty', 'dog', 'fish', 'bird'
]

print(favorite_animals_list)


print('--------------- Challenge 2')
# Challenge 2:
# Use print statements, print each of your favorite animals on a separate line.
# Printing "kitty" is done for you, but commented out -- how will you print the
# others?

print(favorite_animals_list[0])
print(favorite_animals_list[1])
print(favorite_animals_list[2])
print(favorite_animals_list[3])

print('--------------- Challenge 3')
# Challenge 3:
# Now it's time to write a dictionary! It should be just like the list, except
# with each "key" being the name of the animal, and each "value" being the
# noise that it makes. The first one (kitty) is done for you.
favorite_animals_dict = {
    'kitty': 'meow',
    'dog': 'woof',
    'fish': 'gulp',
    'bird': 'sqwak',
}







print('--------------- Challenge 4')
# Challenge 4:
# Now, using the dictionary you made in challenge 3, print each animal name,
# followed by the noise it makes. Kitty is done for you, but "commented out".
#
# Hint: You can use "," in print to print multiple things on the same line

#print('Kitty says:', favorite_animals_dict['kitty'])








print('--------------- Challenge 5')
# Challenge 5:
# Data types can be combined. Transform the following list into a dictionary
# where each key is the category of animal, and the values are the list of the
# animals that fall under that category.

animals = [
    # canines
    'dogs',
    'wolves',

    # felines
    'cats',
    'tigers',

    # rodents
    'mice',
    'hamsters',
    'gerbils',
    'capybaras',

    # notochord retaining fish
    'hagfish',
    'lamprey',
    'coelacanth',
    'sturgeon',
]






# Advanced Bonus Challenges:
# This is a "code design" challenge. What type of container data-type would you
# use for each of the following scenarios? Create an variable with example data
# for each scenario.
#
# 1. File paths, e.g. for content for a static site generator
# 2. Translation of words from one language to another
# 3. Dog breeds and their average longevity
# 4. Harder: Locations: Places in a mapping application like Google Maps or
#    Yelp, including their latitude and longitude and reviews
